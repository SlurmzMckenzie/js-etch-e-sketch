# js-jquery-sketch

Javascript project for The Odin Project

This project was for the Javascript/jQuery section of Web Development 101.

I have built the EtchASketch with vanilla Javascript rather than jQuery as it was more of a challenge and I wanted to focus on speed.

I have left all my comments in  my code for future reference and in case anyone ever looks at it.

I did the optional task of doing random colours, but rather than purely random colours for every square I made the function do random variations of the existing colour so that the changes are gradual as you colour on the canvas as I felt that looked nicer.
